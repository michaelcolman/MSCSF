Basic instructions to modify the code in multiple ways.
Please see full documentation for more details of file and struct contents.
This source code is proivided with no conditions or limitations as to what you can do to modify it.
If you want any new components you have added to be included in the distribution version of the code, 
please email me your updates (with a list of changes) and I will review and decide on whether to include it
in the package.

See "AVAILABLE_MODEL_LIST.txt" for all available cell and tissue models, thier identifiers and filenames.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Forward:
    The code is designed to facilitate easy incorporation of new modulation models (e.g. celltype, remodelling, mutation...), 
    tissue models (idealsed or using reconstructed anatomical geometries), spontaneous release function models, and whole new cell models. 
    Instructions of how to do these are given here. Given that it is in C/C++, any modification is possible, but more complex modifications 
    will require your own knowledge of the code. Hopefully the descriptions of the contents and sequences in the full documentation will faciliate this.
    Below instructions should cover the majority of additional required functionality.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Variables:
    All of the variables are contained within structs, defined in lib/Structs.h:

    • Argument_parameters:
        • variables for all user controlled options, assigned from command-line arguments
          and from which parameters in other structs are assigned.
    
    • Simulation_parameters:
        • BCL, Total_time, NBeats, S2, NS2, dt
        • Vclamp On/Off
        • Read/write state On/Off
        • Directory simulation references
    
    • Cell_parameters:
        • model conditions (Celltype, ISO, Remodelling etc)
        • constants (R, T, F etc)
        • Cell structure parameters (Cm, size and volumes etc)
        • stimulus parameters (magnitude and duration)
        • current and flux parameters (gNa, J_SERCA_max, affinity constants etc)
        • modifier parameters (current/flux scaling, voltage shifts, time-constant scales) ** these are used for new modulations

    • State_variables:
        • Vm
        • ionic concentrations
        • ion current gating variables
        • calicum handling gating and time-dependent buffering variables
    
    • Model_variables:
        • stimulus variables (Istim and sitm flags)
        • reversal potentials
        • currents, fluxes and calculated variables (INa, Jup, transition rates etc)       
        • excitation measurement properties (excitation state, dvdt, APD etc)
    
    • Tissue_parameters:
        • Tissue model conditions (Tissue model, Tissue order, heterogeneity etc)
        • Stimulus location parameters
        • Tissue map flags
        • Tissue dimensions
        • Geometry, stimulus and modulation maps and map filenames
        • Heterogeneity and anistropy settings
        • Conduction velocity measurement variables

    • Spontaneous_release_functions
        • SRF mode and conditions
        • Input variables for the SRF
        • Calculated SRF variables

    Variables related to the 3D calcium handling system are in further structs. 
    However, these are not necessary for any of the modifications described here.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Naming convention:
    Throughout the code, the following convention is used to name variables 
    (NOT implementing the standard gating varibale names):
    Current_activator_activation/inactivation_additional_ref

    i.e. 
        the voltage activation gate for the sodium current is:
            INa_va (this is the state variable - in State_variables struct)

        calcium inactivation gate for ICaL:
            ICaL_ci (this is the state variable)

        steady-state for voltage activation gate of Ito:
            Ito_va_ss (this is a computed variable - in Model_variables struct)

        time constant for inactivation gate of IKur:
            IKur_vi_tau (this is a computed variable)

I personally found this much more useful and convenient than using "random" letters for each
gate and current, which may not be obvious what they are and may vary from model to model.

Adding variables:

You may need to add new variables to the code as part of any modification you are making;
variables for most model components already exist, so first please to check lib/Structs.h 
for matcing or suitably similar variable.
If your variable does not already exist, then you will need to add it. This procedure depends
on the type of variable you are adding:

• Local variables: if the variable is computed for the calculation of a current/flux/concentration,
    and is not required for use outside of its used function, create it locally. Otherwise:

• Parameters: Add the parameter to the appropriate location of "Cell_parameters" struct. 
    It is now ready to be used - simply give it a value in the relevant set_parameters_native_X() 
    function in lib/Model_X.cpp, or in set_default_parameters() in lib/Initialisation.c, if it applies 
    to multiple models. 

• Computed variables (e.g. steady state, transition rates, currents, fluxes): Simply add to the
    appropriate location of the "Model_variables" struct. It is now ready to be accessed from any function
    which reads in Model_variables.

• State variables: 
    • Add to struct "State_variables". 
    • Set the intial condition in initial_conditions_native_X().
    • Finally, add it to read/write state functionality. In lib/Read_write_state.c, navigate to the first two
        funtions "{Write/Read}_state_variables_native()" and follow the instructions at the bottom of each function
        to add a new variable. 

• Modifier variables (current/flux scaling; voltage shifts etc): 
    • Add to the appropriate location of "Cell_parameters" struct (search "MODIFIERS"). 
    • Set the default value in set_modification_defaults_native() in lib/Model.c (1 for scale; 0 for shift).
    • Note: shift applies by adding to V1/2 and thus subtracting from V.

• Tissue parameters. Add to "Tissue_parameters" struct and default in set_tissue_model_conditions() in
    lib/Tissue.cpp. Set either here or in relevant set tissue settings functions (set_tissue_settings_idealised() or
    set_tissue_settings_anatomical() ). 

• Variable/parameter to be controlled from command line arguments:
    • First, add the variable itself as above (e.g. a current scale modifier); the following describes how to
        set and modify this variable from command line/settings_file arguments; the variable itself must already
        be included and do what you want it to!
    • In the "Argument_parameters" struct (last one in the Structs.h file), add:
        • A copy of the variable you want to modify (e.g. a new current scale)
        • A boolean flag variable with the same name with "_arg" appended.
    • Default the ".._arg" boolean to false in lib/Arguments.c -> set_argument_defaults().
    • Add a condition to the IF statements in function set_arguments() in lib/Arguments.c, following the
        examples already present. Ensure to set the flag and increment arg_counter within this conditional.
    • Add your new argument and its options to screen outputs at the bottom of that function.
    • In lib/Initialisation.c, navigate to assign_modification_from_arguments() and add a line which sets 
        the model variable to the argument variable if the _arg flag has been set to true (follow examples).
        This will ensure the argument value will be applied, but only if argument is passed.
    • If it is a tissue parameter, then you may also need to navigate to overwrite_tissue_properties_from_args()
        in lib/Tissue.cpp and add a clause there to overwrite/set the tissue parameter from your argument parameter.
    • Finally, you can add it to screen settings outputs in output_settings() in lib/Outputs.cpp.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

You probably want to add a citation to any component you add.
In lib/Outputs.cpp go to output_disclaimer_citations(), simply add an entry here which prints the citation to screen
if your new model/component is used.

1) Adding a new celltype or modulation model:
    
    Celltype and modulation models can apply to all, some or just specific implemented cell models.
    
    Modulation is implemented using the modifier parameters of the Cell_parameters struct.
    In lib/Structs.h, search "MODIFIERS" for a full list.
        • Scale factors: Gx where x is current or flux identifier; defauled to 1.0.
        • Time constant scaling: Ix_vy_tau_scale where x is current and y is gating variable; defaulted to 1.0.
        • Voltage shifts: defaulted to 0.0. 
            • Ix_vy_ss_shift    - shifts the V1/2 of the steady state of gate y (a, i).
            • Ix_vu_tau_shift   - shifts voltage dependence of time constant of gate y
        • Gradient scaling – denoted Ix_vy_ss_kscale – scales the gradient parameter of regular sigmoidal functions 
            for the steady state of current x and gate y. Defaulted to 1.0. 

    • Adding a model-specific celltype or modulation model:
        • Open the relevant model's file: lib/Model_X.cpp where X is the model identifier (list of all available models in the documentation and AVAILABLE_MODEL_LIST.txt)
        • Navigate to the appropriate function:
            • set_celltype_native_X()
            • update_celltype_integrated_X()
            • set_modulation_ISO_native_X()
            • set_modulation_Agent_native_X()
            • set_modulation_Remodelling_native_X()
            • set_modulation_Mutation_native_X()
            • set_modulation_ACh_X()
            • If the function is not present in your selected cell model, copy the template function from lib/Model_TEMPLATE.cpp
                and add the function call to set_het_mod_X() and the function to lib/Model.h.
        • Follow the in-code instructions for incorporating your model, using the modifier parameters described above.

    • Adding a global or common celltype or modulation model:
        • In lib/Model.c navigate to set_heterogeneity_and_modulation_native()
        • If your model fits within an entry already in Global or common, simply navigate to the
            relevant function and add your modifier following the examples.
        • If it is a new global or common type (e.g. human ventricular celltypes, ISO common to
            a set of models etc - which are currently not in the model) 
            Simply copy the template set_MODIFIER_X_Y() (below the present function) and
            implement according to instructions in both functions. Rename the function as 
            appropriate and add it to lib/Model.h

    • Adding a spatial gradient model:
        • Adding a spatial gradient model, such as apico-basal ventricular heterogeneity gradients 
            is unique in that it is only implemented globally (as it will depend on geoemtry and species, but
            not specific cell models).
        • Simply navigate to set_spatial_gradient() in lib/Model.c and add your model there, giving it an 
            appropriate specific identifier.
        • In tissue models, implementation will also require a spatial gradient map; in single cells, 
            the gradient parameter can be controlled through the argument "Spatial_gradient_proportion [0-1]"

    • NOTE on ICaL and JREL modifiers:
        • In the integrated cell models, both fluxes can be scaled by either scaling the expression (NLTCC, NRyR) or
            the open state transition rate (GLTCC_kva1_va2, GRyR_kCO).
        • In native models, only the expression can be scaled (GCaL, Grel).
        • To keep consistent and allow the same modification model to apply to both native and integrated, the following occurs:
            • In the native model, GCaL is scaled directly and also by GLTCC_kva1_va2 and similar for RyR;
            • In integrated models, the parameters GCaL and Grel scale NLTCC and NRyR;
            • Thus, set either GCaL or GLTCC_kva1_va2; Grel or GRyR_kCO, depending on what you want:
                • In native models, they both do the same thing - so functionality can be distinguised in integrated models and simultaneously
                    be consistent in native models.
                • To chose which to do, think about whether your change in current/flux is due to channel expression (e.g. remodelling, celltype)
                    or dynamic/functional change in channel activity (e.g. ISO, ACh). If the former, use GCaL/Grel; if the latter, use the
                    transition rate scaling. Use voltage clamp to set the correct scaling to match overall chnage in flux (not necessarily linear).
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
   
2) Adding a new tissue model:
    
    New idealised or anatomically detailed tissue models can be easily added in lib/Tissue.cpp
    Simply navigate to 
        • set_tissue_settings_idealised() for an idealised model.
        • set_tissue_settings_anatomical() for an anatomically detailed model.
    Create a new ELSE IF condition at the bottom of the list, following the examples given in "functional_model_test", 
    which contains examples of all currently implemented functionality and instructions on file format etc.
    If using anatomical, you will need to create all geo, stim and map files and put them in your PATH location
    in the directory "Tissue_geometries", following file format instructions in the code.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

3) Adding a new spontaneous release function model:

    Spontnaeous release function parameters are controlled in lib/Spontaneous_release_functions.cpp
    You can add a new model for Direct_control (static probability distribution settings) or Dynamic, either
    based on analysis of the 3D cell or general and controllabe.
    
    Sinmply navigate to the appropraite function (below) and add an ELSE IF condition following the examples already present.
    
        • set_SRF_Direct_Control_parameters()       - single distributions from which to sample parameters
        • set_SRF_dynamic_parameters_3D_cell()      - CaSR dependent distributions, fit to 3D cell model behaviour
        • set_SRF_dynamic_parameters_controllable() - CaSR dependent distributions, general and controllable

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

4) Adding a new current to an existing cell model.

    First, determine if variables for the current already exist (even if not implemented in the 
    appropraite cell model) -> can check lib/Model_TEMPLATE.cpp as this has template functions for
    every current implemented in the framework. You can also copy these functions and use as a guide.
    
    If the current does not already exist, or you need to add new variables, follow some/all of the procedure below:

        • Add any and all relevant:
            • State variables (time-dependent) 
            • Computed variables (time-indepdent; transition rates, currents etc)
            • Parameters (conductance, affinities etc)
            • Modulation variables (Current/flux scaling; voltage shifts etc)
        Following the guidelines above in this document.

        • Then, simply add new functions to your cell model (lib/Model_X.cpp; lib/Model.h) - use template and other
            functions as a guide.

        • Call the new current functions within compute_model_X_native()/compute_model_X_integrated() + update gating variables
            and don't forget to add it to Itot in compute_Itot_X_native()/compute_Itot_X_integrated()

        • You may also want to add it to the data outputs: lib/Outputs.cpp output_currents() and/or
            output_CRU().
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

5) Adding a whole new cell model:
    
    lib/Model_TEMPLATE.cpp has been given to facilitate easy incorporation of new cell models, maintaining all of the
        functionality of the framework.

    • First, determine an identifier for your model. 
        This can have any form you like, with the convention: speciesCELL_MODEL. 
        For example, Grandi-Bers lab human atrial myocyte cell model is "hAM_GB"
        This will be used for function and file naming as well as the string used 
        in IF statements to select your model.

    • Second, copy the template file to a new file called lib/Model_X.cpp where "X" is 
        your model identifier.

    • Follow the embedded instructions in the template (now in your new file).

    • For integrating the AP model with the spatial/0D Ca2+ handling model, you should also add the ICaL function calls to 
        lib/CRU.cpp function set_LTCC_rates(). 
        Note: combining models is rarely trivial!
